      "entry": "Today we continued working on the group project 'Travel the World: I Don't Know'. We also watched Cohort 37's front end capstones. Many students made capstone projects that dealt with organizing and adding items to a collection (Music, Clothes, Chores, etc) While some were polished and some were lacking finish, all were functional. This MVP (minimum viable product) mindset, along with planning, were the most mentioned recommendations from Cohort 37. Planning out your intentions, not allowing function creep, not working yourself into a bad mental state (TAKE BREAKS!!), listening to the instructors and leaning on fellow classmates will go a long way towards carrying us through the pain of our capstone projects.",

It is a fantastic solution that I believe I will go back and implement for all my projects once I have finished with Daily Journal.\n\nTwo new things we learned today are:\nparseInt(), which is a function that parses a string and returns an integer.\n.find(), which is an array method similar to filter, but it instead returns ONLY the first corresponding object in an array, rather than an array with ALL corresponding objects.",
