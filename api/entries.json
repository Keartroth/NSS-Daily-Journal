Many students made capstone projects that dealt with organizing and adding items to a collection (Music, Clothes, Chores, etc) While some were polished and some were lacking finish, all were functional. This MVP (minimum viable product) mindset, along with planning, were the most mentioned recommendations from Cohort 37. Planning out your intentions, not allowing function creep, not working yourself into a bad mental state (TAKE BREAKS!!), listening to the instructors and leaning on fellow classmates will go a long way towards carrying us through the pain of our capstone projects.",
